# Briar Mailbox Home Assistant Add-on

Home Assistant App (Add-on): Briar Mailbox server

The Briar Mailbox project aims to develop an easy way for Briar users to increase their 
reachability and lower the battery drain of their phone.

In Briar messages are exchanged directly between contacts (peer-to-peer). 
This kind of synchronous message exchange requires contacts to be online and 
connected to each other.  
While this is great for privacy (no central server which
can log things or be censored) it's bad for reachability, especially in
mobile networks where connectivity can be limited.
